# **Codility Javascript Template**

This template is designed for developers, that want to train, improve or refresh their skills in _Javascript_ 
by doing the lessons and tasks, provided at [Codility for Programmers](https://app.codility.com/programmers/).

## **Why using this template**

Instead of coding directly in the simple editor on codility, you can use your prefered IDE as usual and copy
and paste your solution after finishing, to the editor and submit your task for evaluating your scores.

## **How to use this template**

1. **Lessons and tasks**
- the 'src'-folder contains the lessons and tasks
- sequence and naming is the same as given on codility

2. **Folder structure**
- in the _main lesson folder_ (e.g. lesson-002-arrays), each lesson provides a _.pdf-file_ with basic material
on the topic the lesson treatens (eg. <lessonnumber><topic>.pdf)

- the _subfolders_ are the tasks itself
- they contain two files:
  1. <taskname>**.solution.js**
  - here you will code your solution function in javascript
  - on the top you got the url to start the corresponding task on codility
  - read the informations there, what your solution function should solve
  - code and test (see below) your solution in your IDE
  - copy it to codility site and submit it
  - notice, that you have to switch manually to javascript on codility site
  2. <taskname>**.test.ts** 
  - contains the documentation and examples for how to set test values of solution function
  - in _const testData = []_, you put your test values
  - below this, you find the 'test-class' itself
